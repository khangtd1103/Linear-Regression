## General Information
- BoomBikes is a A US bike-sharing provider who has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. 
- They want to understand the factors affecting the demand for shared bikes in the American market to cater to the people's needs once the quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.
- The dataset being used is based on meteorological surveys and people's styles on daily bike demands across the American. 

## Conclusions
- A set of 10 features which have impacts on the shared bike demand
- The performance of the model is above 75% 
- The model assumption has been validated
- The most crucial feature is the temperature which is correlated the most on the bike rental quantity.
